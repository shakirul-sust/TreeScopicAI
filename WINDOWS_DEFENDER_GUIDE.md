# Fixing Windows Defender False Positives

## Why Windows Defender flags TreeScopeAI as malicious

Windows Defender sometimes flags applications built with frameworks like Tauri as malicious due to:
1. Lack of code signing
2. Behaviors that resemble malware (file system access, network requests)
3. Low prevalence of the application (not widely distributed yet)

## Solution: Code Signing

The most reliable way to prevent Windows Defender false positives is to digitally sign your application.

### Steps to implement code signing:

1. **Obtain a Code Signing Certificate**
   - Purchase from a Certificate Authority (CA) like DigiCert, Sectigo, or GlobalSign
   - For testing, you can create a self-signed certificate (not recommended for production)

2. **Set up certificate in Tauri configuration**
   - Create/update `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` with Windows signing options:
   ```json
   "windows": {
     "certificateThumbprint": "YOUR_CERTIFICATE_THUMBPRINT",
     "digestAlgorithm": "sha256",
     "timestampUrl": "http://timestamp.digicert.com"
   }
   ```

3. **Sign the application during build process**
   - For Windows, use SignTool.exe (part of Windows SDK)
   - Add a post-build script in your package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "build": "vite build",
     "tauri": "tauri",
     "sign-windows": "SignTool sign /fd SHA256 /a /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td SHA256 path\\to\\your\\app.exe"
   }
   ```

## Alternative Solutions

If code signing is not immediately possible:

### 1. Add to Windows Defender exclusions
Instruct users to add the application to Windows Defender exclusions:
- Open Windows Security
- Go to Virus & threat protection
- Under Virus & threat protection settings, click "Manage settings"
- Scroll down to Exclusions and click "Add or remove exclusions"
- Add the installation directory of TreeScopeAI

### 2. Submit app for Microsoft malware analysis
Submit your application to Microsoft for analysis:
- Visit https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission
- Submit your executable for analysis
- This can help prevent future false positives

### 3. Technical mitigations for Tauri apps

Update your Tauri build configuration:
- Limit file system access to only what's necessary
- Add proper vendor and publisher metadata
- Include clear version numbers and application identity

## Implementation for TreeScopeAI

For TreeScopeAI, implement the following:

1. Create/edit `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` with proper metadata
2. Configure restricted file system access
3. Add your company information to build metadata
4. Set up code signing workflow
5. Include instructions for users if false positives continue to occur

These measures will significantly reduce the likelihood of false positives from Windows Defender and other security software.
