# TreeScopeAI UI Updates

This document outlines the UI improvements made to the TreeScopeAI application.

## Changes Implemented

### Header Logo and Alignment
- Fixed vertical alignment of the logo in the header
- Replaced the existing icon with a custom SVG tree icon that better represents the application
- Reduced the gap between the icon and the "TreeScopeAI" text
- Changed subtitle from "Tree Species Identification" to "Wood Species Classifier"
- Made the header responsive across different screen sizes

### API Connection Handling
- Made the API base URL configurable using environment variables
- Added comprehensive mock data for offline mode
- Improved the API error notification with:
  - More compact, less intrusive design
  - Auto-dismiss after 10 seconds
  - Friendly "Using Offline Mode" messaging
  - Simple "Reconnect" button
- Enhanced fallback mechanism to use realistic mock data when API is unreachable, including:
  - Multiple tree species with detailed information
  - Random selection for better demo experience
  - Higher confidence scores for more realistic results

## Configuration

To configure the API URL, create a `.env.local` file in the project root with:

```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
```

## Responsive Design

The UI has been made responsive with:
- Proper alignment and spacing in both desktop and mobile views
- Graceful degradation when the API is unavailable
- Better visual consistency across different screen sizes

## Testing

To test the fallback functionality:
1. Set an invalid API URL in your `.env.local` file
2. Run the application
3. Verify that the API error notification appears with the "Using Offline Mode" message
4. Confirm that realistic mock data is displayed when performing image analysis
