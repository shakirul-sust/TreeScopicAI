# TreeScopeAI - Next Steps

## Project Status

We've successfully created the structure and core components of the TreeScopeAI wood species classifier application:

1. ✅ Project structure and organization
2. ✅ SQLite database schema and initialization scripts
3. ✅ FastAPI backend for Hugging Face model hosting
4. ✅ Tauri + React frontend structure
5. ✅ Activation key system
6. ✅ Core UI components and styling
7. ✅ Rust backend for Tauri

## Next Steps to Complete the Project

### 1. Development Environment Setup

- [ ] Install Node.js and npm
- [ ] Install Rust and Cargo
- [ ] Install Tauri CLI
- [ ] Install required dependencies using `npm install`

### 2. Database Initialization

- [ ] Run `npm run init-db` to create and populate the SQLite database

### 3. Hugging Face Model Deployment

- [ ] Train or acquire a YOLOv11 model for wood species classification
- [ ] Create a Hugging Face Space
- [ ] Upload the model file and API code to the Space
- [ ] Deploy the API
- [ ] Update the `API_URL` in `Dashboard.jsx` to point to your Hugging Face Space

### 4. Application Testing

- [ ] Test the activation system
- [ ] Test image uploading and classification
- [ ] Test species information display
- [ ] Test responsiveness and UI across different platforms

### 5. Building for Production

- [ ] Update application icons in `src-tauri/icons/`
- [ ] Run `npm run tauri build` to create platform-specific binaries
- [ ] Create installer scripts if needed
- [ ] Generate activation keys for distribution

### 6. Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add offline model for using the app without internet connection
- [ ] Implement multilingual support
- [ ] Add ability to save classification results
- [ ] Create a system for updating the species database
- [ ] Add image annotation capabilities
- [ ] Implement batch processing for multiple images

## How to Run in Development Mode

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Initialize the database
npm run init-db

# Start development server
npm run tauri dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run tauri build
```

The binaries will be available in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle` directory.
